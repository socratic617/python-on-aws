# Assignment: Implement the "happy path" for Files API Endpoints

In this exercise, you will implement the REST API endpoints for the Files API.

Do not worry about

- documentation (the OpenAPI schema)
- error handling, error response status codes, or data validation, just do the "happy path"
- logging
- versioning

We will implement those in later assignments.

## Assignment

There are 2 main parts to this assignment:

1. Implement the endpoints as shown below by their example requests and responses.
2. For each endpoint, implement the full checklist laid out in [`./api-checklist.md`](./api-checklist.md).

Subsequent assignments will build on this one, adding more polish in their own checklist items.

## Endpoints (implement these)

- `PUT /files/{filePath}`: Upload or overwrite a file. (see note below, why we use PUT for both create and update, and do not have a `POST` method)
- `GET /files`: List files metadata with pagination support.
- `GET /files/{filePath}`: Get a file by its path.
- `HEAD /files/{filePath}`: Get metadata of a file by its path (rather than the whole file).
- `DELETE /files/{filePath}`: Delete a file by its path.


> ðŸ“Œ **Design Note:** We are using PUT for both create and update options instead of POST because this API is atypical. In most REST APIs, the POST request accepts data, creates an object, and assigns it an ID. 
> 
> This is good because it's best not to allow users to have control over ID generation, e.g., to help ensure resource IDs are unique among other reasons. The fact that this is a file server makes our API a special case because it makes more sense for an API like this to have the URN be a file path rather than creating a separate URN, e.g., a UUID for each file. 
> 
> File paths already guarantee uniqueness, the ability to look up the resource, etc. So in this case, we use a PUT for both create and update operations. The PUT verb assumes that the URN is known by the user. In our case, it is.

## Endpoints and Schemas Summary

### 1. Upload or Overwrite File
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /files/{filePath}`
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `filePath` (required, string)
- **Request Body**: Accept a file in the request body as binary data.
- **Response**: Return 
  - a `201 Created` status code on successful created file (where no file existed before)
  - a `204 No Content` status code on successful overwrite of an existing file

#### Example Request:
```bash
PUT /files/myfolder/file1.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

(file content here)
```

#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "New file uploaded: /path/to/file"
}
```

### 2. List Files
- **Endpoint**: `GET /files`
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `pageSize` (optional, integer, default: 10)
  - `directory` (optional, string)
  - `pageToken` (optional, string)
- **Response**: JSON with a list of files and pagination tokens.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /files?pageSize=5&directory=myfolder&pageToken=abc123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
```

#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "files": [
    {
      "key": "/myfolder/file1.txt",
      "lastModified": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "sizeBytes": 12345
    },
    {
      "key": "/myfolder/file2.txt",
      "lastModified": "2023-01-02T00:00:00Z",
      "sizeBytes": 67890
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "next_page_token_value",
  "remainingPages": 2
}
```

### 3. Get File
- **Endpoint**: `GET /files/{filePath}`
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `filePath` (required, string)
- **Response**: Returns the file content with the appropriate MIME type or a 404 error if not found.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /files/myfolder/file1.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
```

#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 12345

(file content here)
```

#### Example Error Response (optional for this assignment):
```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "detail": "File not found: /myfolder/file1.txt"
}
```

### 4. Get File Metadata
- **Endpoint**: `HEAD /files/{filePath}`
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `filePath` (required, string)
- **Response**: Returns the file metadata or a 404 error if not found.

#### Example Request:
```bash
HEAD /files/myfolder/file1.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
```

#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 12345
Last-Modified: 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

#### Example Error Response (optional for this assignment):
```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "detail": "File not found: /myfolder/file1.txt"
}
```

### 5. Delete File
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /files/{filePath}`
- **Path Parameters**:
  - `filePath` (required, string)
- **Response**: Return a 200 status code on successful deletion, or a 404 status code if the file is not found.

#### Example Request:
```bash
DELETE /files/myfolder/file1.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
```

#### Example Response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "File deleted successfully"
}
```

#### Example Error Response (optional for this assignment):
```bash
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "detail": "File not found: /myfolder/file1.txt"
}
```
