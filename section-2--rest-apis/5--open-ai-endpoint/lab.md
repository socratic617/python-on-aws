## Overview

This lab is self-directed and open-ended. 

The objective is to write one or more endpoints that save files to S3. The files should be generated by the OpenAI API.

## Resources

- [`./notebooks/openai-sdk.ipynb`](./notebooks/openai-sdk.ipynb) shows you how to 
  - use the OpenAI API with its SDK
  - mock API calls performed by the SDK (one way of mocking at least)

## Success criteria

- [ ] **Add at least one endpoint** that, when given a `prompt`, generates a files of type
  - [ ] image
  - [ ] audio
  - [ ] or text
  - [ ] And saves it to S3 with the proper mime type

- [ ] **Securely handle the OpenAI API secret key**, i.e. do not hard code it anywhere that could be committed

- [ ] Follow the principles outlined in the **API Design checklists** of the previous sections. 
  - [ ] Validate inputs
  - [ ] Handle edge/error cases
  - [ ] Generate the relevant metadata into the OpenAPI doc

- [ ] **Write tests for the endpoint(s)** you created
  - [ ] Test the happy path
  - [ ] Test edge/error cases
  - [ ] Consider mocking the OpenAI SDK for both testing and development to save money
  - [ ] Either
    - [ ] Run or tests in C.I. (including your mocking)
    - [ ] OR define a "pytest marker" to skip tests in C.I. that require hitting OpenAI's API.
