# Create API Gateways

The scripts in this folder can be used to create AWS API Gateways as shown in the video lectures.

1. A `/greeting` endpoint with a Mock integration that uses a response transformation template
2. An `/echo` resources backed by a lambda function that echoes the JSON representation of the HTTP request. This can be really useful for creating sample events to test lambda functions locally.
